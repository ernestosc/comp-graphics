Part A - Forward Kinematics

"Animatics" Report

*************** Compiling Instructions ******************

	Please use Apache Ant's 'ant' command on your console
	while in the base directory.

*************** Project Description *********************

	For Part A, I have implemented forward kinematics for
	the following character models:

		-  3-Link Serial Manipulator
		- 10-Link Serial Manipulator
		- Customized Binary Tree Web

	Each of these models includes 3 kinds of joints:

		- Revolute Joints 			: 1 Angle  DOF
		- Prismatic Joints 			: 1 Length DOF
		- Spherical (Ball) Joints   : 2 Angles DOF

	I have made a recursive rendering method that performs
	the apprpriate rotations, translations, and scales for
	the various joint types.

	In addition, I have allowed for the user to specify which
	joint to manipulate through a mouse picking interface.

	Simply click on the joint you desire to move.

	See the controls below for more details.

*********** Control Flow / User Interface ***************

	The program has two modes:

		- Forward Kinematics
		- Inverse Kinematics

	For Part A, the program begins running in FK Mode.
	Please maintain this mode while switching between models.

	User Keys/Controls:

	- Press TAB     : Switch between Forward and Inverse Kinematics
	- Press UP      : Move Camera Forward
	- Press DOWN    : Move Camera Backward
	- Press LEFT    : Move Camera Left
	- Press RIGHT   : Move Camera Right
	- Press SPACE   : Move Camera Up
	- Press R_SHIFT : Move Camera Down
	- Press PERIOD  : Move Camera Faster
	- Press COMMA   : Move Camera Slower

	- Press ESC		: Close Window and Program
	- Press P 		: Take Snapshot

	If in Forward Kinematics Mode
	- Press 1  :  Render  3-Link Manipulator
	- Press 2  :  Render 10-Link Manipulator
	- Press 3  :  Render Binary Tree Web

	If in Inverse Kinematics Mode
	- Press 1  :  Render 7-Link Manipulator
	- Press 2  :  Render Binary Tree Web

	- Click Left Mouse Button : Select A Joint/Link To Manipulate

	- Press EQUALS  : Increase: 	Angle      (Revolute)
							   	   Length 	   (Prismatic)
							   Azimuthal Angle (Spherical)
	- Press MINUS	: Decreases

	- Press 0	: Increase Polar Angle (Spherical Joint Only)
	- Press 9	: Decrease Polar Angle (Spherical Joint Only)

	Can you guess what kind of joint each joint in a model is?
	Click around and discover!

******* Extra Features *******
