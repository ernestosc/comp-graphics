Part B - Inverse Kinematics

"Animatics" Report

*************** Compiling Instructions ******************

	Please use Apache Ant's 'ant' command on your console
	while in the base directory.

*************** Project Description *********************

	For Part B, I have implemented inverse kinematics for
	the following character models:

		-  7-Link Serial Manipulator
		- Customized Binary Tree Web

	These models comprise, respectively:
		- One chain of sequenced links.
		- A multi-branch model showcasing the correct
		  implementation of damping least squares with
		  ancestral tracing.

	I have made a recursive rendering method that performs
	the appropriate rotations, translations, and scales for
	the various joint types.

	In addition, I have allowed for the user to specify which
	joint to manipulate through a mouse picking interface.

	Part of this mouse-controlled target-picking involves the
	implementation of a screen-to-world coordinates transformation.

	To compute the Jacobian for Damping Least Squares, I use
	derivative formulas given in a slide presentation cited 
	below under Resources.

	Simply click on the joint you desire to move.

	See the controls below for more details.

*********** Control Flow / User Interface ***************

	The program has two modes:

		- Forward Kinematics
		- Inverse Kinematics

	For Part B, the program begins running in IK Mode.
	Please maintain this mode while switching between models.

	User Keys/Controls:

	- Press TAB     : Switch between Forward and Inverse Kinematics
	- Press UP      : Move Camera Forward
	- Press DOWN    : Move Camera Backward
	- Press LEFT    : Move Camera Left
	- Press RIGHT   : Move Camera Right
	- Press SPACE   : Move Camera Up
	- Press R_SHIFT : Move Camera Down
	- Press PERIOD  : Move Camera Faster
	- Press COMMA   : Move Camera Slower

	- Press ESC		: Close Window and Program
	- Press P 		: Take Snapshot

	If in Forward Kinematics Mode
	- Press 1  :  Render  3-Link Manipulator
	- Press 2  :  Render 10-Link Manipulator
	- Press 3  :  Render Binary Tree Web

	If in Inverse Kinematics Mode
	- Press 1  :  Render 7-Link Manipulator
	- Press 2  :  Render Binary Tree Web

	- Click Left Mouse Button : Select A Joint/Link To Manipulate
	  ** Once A Joint Is Selected:
	  		You may click again anywhere to move the selected
	  		end effector to that point.

	  *** NOTE: 
	  	In my implementation, the end effector is the "tip" of the
	  	selected link. So when a sphere is highlighted as the current
	  	joint, it is the tip of the link that grows out from the sphere
	  	that should reach the target position.

	Choose a joint and click around to have it go different places.

	Be surprised by the secrets revealed as you move more joints in
	the binary tree model!

******* Extra Features *******

	Betond the required features, I have implemented:
		Lighting and Material Colors
		Textured Environment
		World Coordinate Axes
		Color Highlighting The Controlled Joint

******* Resources Used *******

I followed this tutorial for implementing Mouse Picking:

My implementation of Damped Least Squares comes from the source
provided in the course site:

	Buss, Samuel R., "Introduction to Inverse Kinematics 
					  with Jacobian Transpose, Pseudoinverse 
					  and Damped Least Squares methods", UCSD, 2009.

My implementation of the Jacobian comes from the slides found at:
