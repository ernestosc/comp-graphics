Course projects completed for Columbia University's 
COMS W 4160 Spring 2015 computer graphics course as
taught by Professor Changxi Zheng.

These programs used a simple LWJGL cube renderer &
camera class supplied by the course instructors as a 
starting point.

The projects presented here include:

 - 3D Pong Environment 

	My first use of OpenGL. Sets up an interactive 3D
	pong game scene with player motion capabilties.

	Ball rebound and collision not yet implemented. I
	plan on making this a fully functional pong game
	in the future.

 - Forward/Inverse Kinematics
 
	An interactive F/I kinematics implementation with
	a simple user interface to demonstrate the motion
	of various link-joint configurations when various
	joint parameters are changed.

	Joints are clickable and structure motion is real
	time.

 - GLSL GPU Shaders 

    My first use of GLSL. Implements Gouraud and Blinn
	Phong shaders under the Phong reflectance model. 

	Also implements several procedural texture patterns
	and a simple blue-hued toon shader.

 - Monte Carlo Ray Tracing 

 	Presents the resulting images of a Monte Carlo ray
	tracing code base written mostly Prof. Zheng.

	My contribution to the code base comprised ray-to-
	sphere intersection detection, Phong shading, and
	the actual integral computation necessary for the
	model's reflectance values.

	Both direct illumination and recursive radiance
	tracing were implemented.

 - See http://github.com/ltolosa/A-Maze-3D for a
   collaborative maze-solving game made for also
   for this course.
